# AGENTS.md

Development guidelines for the wmao project.

For specific guidelines, see:
- [Backend Guidelines](backend/AGENTS.md) - Read before editing Go code in backend/
- [Frontend Guidelines](frontend/AGENTS.md) - Read before editing frontend code

## Project Overview

wmao (Work My Ass Off) manages multiple coding agents in parallel. Each task
runs in an isolated [md](https://github.com/maruel/md) container with Claude
Code communicating via streaming JSON over SSH.

### Documentation Changes

- **Do NOT** create a markdown file listing changes you made.
- **Always update the purpose comment** at the beginning of a source file when
  the code's purpose changes. This comment is used to generate the file index
  in `AGENTS.md`.

### Professionalism

After making changes, run:

```bash
make lint build test
```

<!-- BEGIN FILE INDEX -->
## File Index

Autogenerated file index based on first-line comments.

- `README.md`: wmao
- `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`: wmao - Requirements
<!-- END FILE INDEX -->
