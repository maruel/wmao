# AGENTS.md

Development guidelines for the wmao project.

For specific guidelines, see:
- [Backend Guidelines](backend/AGENTS.md) - Read before editing Go code in backend/
- [Frontend Guidelines](frontend/AGENTS.md) - Read before editing frontend code

## Project Overview

wmao (Work My Ass Off) manages multiple coding agents in parallel. Each task
runs in an isolated [md](https://github.com/maruel/md) container with Claude
Code communicating via streaming JSON over SSH.

### Documentation Changes

- **Do NOT** create a markdown file listing changes you made.
- **Always update the purpose comment** at the beginning of a source file when
  the code's purpose changes. This comment is used to generate the file index
  in `AGENTS.md`.

### md Containers

`md start`, `md diff`, `md pull`, and `md kill` operate on the **current git
branch**. The working tree must be checked out to the task's branch before
calling any `md` command for that task.

### Professionalism

After making changes, run:

```bash
make lint build test
```
