# wmao - Requirements

Work My Ass Off: manage multiple coding agents in parallel.

## Overview

wmao orchestrates multiple Claude Code agents running in isolated
[md](https://github.com/maruel/md) containers. Each task gets its own
container+branch, Claude runs inside via SSH with streaming JSON, and results
are pulled back and serialized into the upstream repository.

## Definitions

- **Task**: a user-supplied description of work to do (bug fix, feature, etc.).
- **Container**: an md container (`md-<repo>-<branch>`) providing an isolated
  git clone, accessible via SSH.
- **Agent**: a Claude Code process running inside a container, communicating via
  the streaming JSON protocol over SSH.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Task Submission

- User provides a task description via CLI.
- wmao creates a new git branch from the current HEAD (e.g.,
  `wmao/<timestamp>-<slug>`).
- wmao starts an md container for that branch (`md start --no-ssh`).

### FR-2: Agent Execution

- wmao runs Claude Code inside the container over SSH:
  ```
  ssh <container> claude -p \
    --output-format stream-json --verbose \
    --dangerously-skip-permissions \
    --max-turns <N> \
    "<task description>"
  ```
- Reads stdout as NDJSON, parsing each line into typed messages.
- Relevant message types:
  - `system` (subtype `init`): session metadata.
  - `assistant`: model responses and tool-use requests.
  - `user`: tool results (executed by Claude Code internally).
  - `result`: terminal message indicating success or error.
- The agent is considered done when a `result` message is received.

### FR-3: Result Reporting

- On completion, wmao runs `md diff --stat` to summarize what changed.
- Optionally runs `md diff` for the full patch.
- Reports to the user: task status (success/error), cost, files changed, diff
  summary.

### FR-4: Git Integration

- After the agent finishes, wmao runs `md pull` to bring changes into the local
  branch.
- Multiple agents may finish concurrently; their pulls must be serialized
  (mutex) to avoid conflicts.
- After a successful pull, wmao pushes the branch to `origin`.
- If a push fails due to a race, wmao rebases and retries.

### FR-5: Parallel Execution

- wmao can run multiple tasks concurrently, each in its own container.
- Each task is independent: separate branch, separate container, separate
  agent.
- A status display shows all running tasks and their state.

### FR-6: Cleanup

- After successfully pushing, wmao kills the container (`md kill`).
- On failure, the container is left running for manual inspection.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Simplicity

- Single binary, no config file required. CLI flags and environment variables
  only.

### NFR-2: Observability

- Log all agent streaming output to a file per task for post-mortem.
- Print a summary line per task on completion.

### NFR-3: Error Handling

- If Claude errors out (non-zero exit, error result), report the error and
  leave the container for debugging.
- If `md pull` fails (merge conflict), report and leave the container.

### Key Packages

- `main` — CLI entry point, flag parsing, task dispatch.
- `internal/agent` — Claude Code streaming JSON protocol: types, process
  lifecycle, output parsing.
- `internal/container` — md container management: start, diff, pull, kill.
- `internal/git` — git operations: branch creation, push with retry, conflict
  detection.
- `internal/task` — task orchestration: ties agent + container + git together.

### Claude Code Streaming JSON Types

Input (stdin NDJSON):
```json
{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":"<task>"}}
```

Output (stdout NDJSON) — key types:

| type           | subtype    | Description                          |
|----------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| `system`       | `init`     | Session start, tools, model info     |
| `assistant`    |            | Model response (text or tool_use)    |
| `user`         |            | Tool results from Claude Code        |
| `result`       | `success`  | Task completed successfully          |
| `result`       | `error_*`  | Task failed                          |
| `stream_event` |            | Partial tokens (with --include-partial-messages) |

### Git Flow

1. Create branch `wmao/<slug>` from current HEAD.
2. `md start --no-ssh` on that branch.
3. Agent runs inside container, makes commits.
4. `md pull` rebases container commits onto local branch.
5. `git push origin wmao/<slug>` (serialized across tasks).
6. `md kill` on success.

## CLI Interface

```
wmao run "fix the auth bug in login.go"
wmao run "add pagination to /api/users" "refactor database layer"
wmao status
wmao logs <task-id>
```

### `wmao run <task>...`

- Accepts one or more task descriptions.
- Runs all tasks in parallel.
- Blocks until all complete.
- Prints summary on completion.

### `wmao status`

- Shows running tasks: branch, container, elapsed time, state.

### `wmao logs <task-id>`

- Tails the streaming JSON log for a task.
